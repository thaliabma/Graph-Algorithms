  <li> <h2>Prim Algorithm</h2></li>
  <p>Prim's algorithm is a minimum spanning tree algorithm that takes a graph as input and finds the subset of the edges of that graph which form a tree that includes every vertex
    and has the minimum sum of weights among all the trees that can be formed from the graph.</p>
  <li><h2>Dijkstra's Algorithm</h2></li> 
   <p> Dijkstra's algorithm allows us to find the shortest path between any two vertices of a graph.It differs from the minimum spanning tree because the shortest distance between two vertices might not include all the vertices of the graph. </p>
